## Problem statement

2 numbers are to be given as input say a,b where a & b are natural nos, a < b

We need to print every number from a to b such that the number should contain that many  digits as that of the largest number.

Eg 1:

`input`
1 9

`Output` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Eg 2:

`input`
1 10

`Output` 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10


Eg 3:

`input`
9 456

`Output` 009 010 011 .... ... .. 455 456
